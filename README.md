_Create dynamic business applications faster and safer with an open source platform._

Dynacase Platform is an innovative Open Source PHP platform to develop business applications without 
the disadvantages of a specific development. This is possible thanks to core features provided ‘out-of-the-box’ 
(account management, rights management...), but also through the pre-designed modules for information 
management and business process management.
